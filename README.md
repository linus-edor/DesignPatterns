# DesignPatterns

Simple reference implementations of various design patterns using java.

1. The factory pattern.
A Factory Pattern or Factory Method Pattern says that just define an interface or abstract class for creating an object but let the subclasses decide which class to instantiate. In other words, subclasses are responsible to create the instance of the class.
The Factory Method Pattern is also known as Virtual Constructor.

2. Singleton Pattern says that just"define a class that has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it".

3. Abstract Factory Pattern says that just define an interface or abstract class for creating families of related (or dependent) objects but without specifying their concrete sub-classes.That means Abstract Factory lets a class return a factory of classes. So, this is the reason that Abstract Factory Pattern is one level higher than the Factory Pattern.
